	http://www.raspberryconnect.com/network/item/333-raspberry-pi-hotspot-access-point-dhcpcd-method
	https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md

steps:

* download raspbian 
* edit the config files /boot/config.txt
* use /boot/overlays/README for configuration options
* for serial add : enable_uart=1
* use passwd and change password to <floridefrogs> if you want to be cool

command line steps:

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install hostapd 
	sudo apt-get install dnsmasq

	***check your version with : dpkg -s dnsmasq ******************
		versions 2.77 and above are ok. If not then try the command:
	sudo apt-get purge dns-root-data

	sudo reboot 

	sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf  <dhcpcd is the ip leaser on the system this sets up 1-24 as ips using the wlan0 interface 
		interface wlan0
		    static ip_address=192.168.4.1/24
		    nohook wpa_supplicant

	sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf

		interface=wlan0
		driver=nl80211
		ssid=AlexaJones
		hw_mode=g
		channel=7
		wmm_enabled=0
		macaddr_acl=0
		auth_algs=1
		ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
		wpa=2
		wpa_passphrase=floridefrogs
		wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
		wpa_pairwise=TKIP
		rsn_pairwise=CCMP

	sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd

	DAEMON_CONF="/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"

	sudo systemctl start hostapd
	sudo systemctl start dnsmasq

	sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf 

	net.ipv4.ip_forward=1


	sudo iptables -t nat -A  POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE < this sets up the iptables 
	sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat"
	
	sudo nano /etc/rc.local
		iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat

	sudo reboot


Notes:

serial connection:
	connect to raspberry pi over serial: </dev/ttyUSB0 is the serial device used to communicate to the pi.> < 115200 is the speed>
	screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

dnsmasq:
	Dnsmasq bug: in versions below 2.77 there is a recent bug that may cause the hotspot not to start for some users. This can be resolved by removing the dns-root-data. It may be benificial to do this before you start the rest of the installation as it has been reported that doing it after installation for effected users does not work but you won't know if it is an issue until after the installation is complete.
